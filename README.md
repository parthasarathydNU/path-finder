# AlgoViz
In this project I am building an algorithm visualizer application using React. I will be using this as a learning opportunity for understanding the various path finding algorithms.

# Features to add

1. Make the start and end points draggable
2. Make the grid cells dynamic based on the viewport height and width
3. Make it work on touch screen devices
4. Let users control the grid dimension
5. Add instructions on how to use the application
7. Add new algorithms 
8. Let users select color themes for the application
