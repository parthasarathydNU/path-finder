# AlgoViz
In this project I am building an algorithm visualizer application using React. I will be using this as a learning opportunity for understanding the various path finding algorithms.

# Features to add

1. Make the start and end points draggable - done
5. Add instructions on how to use the application - done


2. Make the grid cells dynamic based on the viewport height and width
3. Make it work on touch screen devices
4. Let users control the grid dimension
7. Add new algorithms 
8. Let users select color themes for the application
9. Improve animation of walls appearing - size
10. Make the app height and width responsive
11. Fix bug - when we move the start and end cells, we should not let the users move it one on top of the other
12. Able to move start ane end nodes even when the current algo is running
13. Un clear movement rules , what happens when we 
14. Ability to draw a wall during algorithsm
